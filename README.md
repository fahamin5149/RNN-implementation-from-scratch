## Description
In this project, I developed a custom implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch using Python. The RNN model was designed to handle sequential data and learn temporal patterns. Key features and steps involved in the project include:

### Model Architecture
Building the RNN architecture, including input, hidden, and output layers, with tanh activation functions in the hidden layers to manage the sequential data.

### Forward Propagation
Implementing the forward pass to calculate the activations and outputs for each time step in the sequence.

### Backward Propagation Through Time (BPTT)
Developing the backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients and update the network's weights, including the unique challenges of handling temporal dependencies.

### Training and Optimization
Training the RNN using gradient descent and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

### Evaluation
Assessing the model's performance on test data and making necessary adjustments to improve accuracy and reduce loss.

This project provided a deep understanding of the inner workings of RNNs and their application in tasks involving sequential data, such as time series prediction and natural language processing.
